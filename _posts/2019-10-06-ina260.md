# INA260 Current Sensing chip

![INA260](http://www.tij.co.jp/ods/images/JAJSCW1C/p1_fbd_sbos656.gif)

I2C interface. Libraries for both Arduino and Raspberry Pi and can be run with 3.3V.

In this diagram, the shunt resistor is only 2 milliohms. It is capable according to technical notes of voltages up to +36V 
and 15A continuous (DC only).

You would connect the load under test as in the diagram above or below.
