Looking for a way to get a USB webcam feed into Home Assistant, I remembered that Octoprint uses [mjpg-streamer](https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer) . 

Home Assistant has a [MJPEG IP Camera integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mjpeg/) .

Install instructions and usage of mjpg-streamer [here](https://gist.github.com/raspberrypisig/394b5fbb0ca7b17bed3afc2c0174c8dc).

It is very responsive, good results.
