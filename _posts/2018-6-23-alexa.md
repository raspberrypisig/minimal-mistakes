There has been a recent re-write of the Alexa App for Raspberry Pi. It used to be written in Java, now it is a C++ app. This is welcome, 
it makes installations less painful.

The instructions to install are [here](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-Quick-Start-Guide-with-Script).

Before you run this, you will need to create an Amazon Account. A good set of instructions to follow are probably steps 2 and 3 of the old guide [here](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app/wiki/Raspberry-Pi)

There is one major gotcha. When you are creating a product in the Amazon Developer Console (developer.amazon.com). The correct Product ID is 
shown, but not the right Client ID.

, but to get the right Client ID, you have to do the following:

- Click *Manage*
- Click *Security Profile*
- Scroll down, then click *Other devices and platforms*
- Click *Add*, give a name and you will get the right Client ID.
