![KiwiSDR Interface](https://github.com/raspberrypisig/raspberrypisig.github.io/raw/master/assets/images/kiwisdr.jpg)

I recently stumbled on a site called [sdr.hu](sdr.hu) .

Here you will find a list of RTL-SDR receivers set up.The one we were playing with yesterday was this one [here](http://kiwisdr.vk3tlw.net:8073/), based somewhere in Burwood.

The interface is a waterfall display, allows you to select center frequency, bands, etc. 

## KiwiSDR
What is interesting about the website is that most people listed there are using something called KiwiSDR. It turns out to be a daughterboard for a 
Beaglebone Black.

Not cheap, Core Electronics sells both Beaglebone Black and the KiwiSDR Board for just under $600.

They more interesting thing is the software they are using is a heavily modified version of an open-source software called OpenWebRX.

## OpenWebRX

OpenWebRX has a web-based interface.

Unfortunately, the interface is not as nice as the one for KiwiSDR, even though it is the same software. It can be installed on Ubuntu
or Raspberry Pi.
