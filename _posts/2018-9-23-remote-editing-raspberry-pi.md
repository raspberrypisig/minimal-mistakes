Like music, everyone has their favourite text editor/IDE. 

I like using Sublime Text 3 for python.I would describe it as text editor with extras. It has syntax highlighting, and I can run the program from within the editor.

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight IDE. It has a great feature for remote editing.
