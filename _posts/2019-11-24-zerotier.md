Better alternative to ngrok.

Benefits:

- Connect up to 100 devices for free.
- You don't need to nominate individual ports that you want to tunnel

To setup:
- Go to zerotier.com and create an account.
- You then create a "network"
- Each device then joins the network, you need to download an zerotier app for that (there is a cli one for arm, a windows client as well)
