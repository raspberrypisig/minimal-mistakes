MotionEye is a popular software that is used to turn your raspberry pi into a CCTV.

The easiest way to install it is using a dedicated raspbian image - instructions [here](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/wiki/Installation)

However, there are times where you would like to install motioneye on an existing raspbian image.

I created a script to do just that:

curl -L http://bit.ly/38eG7gz|sudo -E bash -
