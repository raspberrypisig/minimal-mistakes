Although not a PI robot, there are a few features in terms of the robot and programming environment worth looking at.

First, you program with a web interface.

Second, you can upload programs with a sound card! It uses an IR emitter - assuming same technique as [LIRC audio](http://www.lirc.org/html/audio.html)

It can play music, do line following, respond to clapping, and more.
