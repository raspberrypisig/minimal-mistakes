# Attaching fan to raspberry pi

Aidan came across a circuit for attaching a fan to raspberry pi

![Raspberry Pi Fan Controller](https://github.com/raspberrypisig/raspberrypisig.github.io/raw/master/assets/images/raspberry-pi-fan-controller-schematic.png)

In the diagram, you are using a GPIO pin to control the fan. 

If you want the fan on all the time, you can attach it straight to the 5V pin.

# HomeAssistant floorplan

Rob C. showed me a piece of software called Sweet Home 3D for creating floorplans.

Pretty cool what you can do.

# Smart powerboard and plugs

Rob B. and Sean have separately been playing with Arlec Grid Connect compatible devices that you buy from Bunnings. They can be flashed
with a software called [Tuya Convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert). It replaces the default firmware with Tasmota, which we saw with Sonoff devices.

Good news is the software can be run from the pi.
