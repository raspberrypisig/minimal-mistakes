# Attaching fan to raspberry pi

Aidan came across a circuit for attaching a fan to raspberry pi

![Raspberry Pi Fan Controller](https://github.com/raspberrypisig/raspberrypisig.github.io/raw/master/assets/images/raspberry-pi-fan-controller-schematic.png)

In the diagram, you are using a GPIO pin to control the fan. 

If you want the fan on all the time, you can attach straight to the 5V pin.
