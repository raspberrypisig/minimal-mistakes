### PySimpleGUI
An easy way to create a GUI with python. Works on the raspberry pi. 

[Link here](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Kedei TFT 3.5 inch LCD
Had trouble with this touch display with buster, worked in the past with stretch.

### Kubernetes on Pi
For those interested in setting up clusters with Pi, it is made dead easier with K3s on a raspberry pi.

[Link here](https://github.com/rancher/k3s)

To install a dashboard, requires a bit more work. Two options, Kubernetes Dashboard or VMWare Octant (attempting to produce instructions
on how to port this to Raspberry Pi).

### ATTiny85
Not Pi related, but been playing with microprocessor. It is AVR-based like an arduino, with a couple of important differences:

- PLL built-in, can be used as source for timer (up to 64MHz)
- can use external clock as system clock and source for timers
- can be powered by 3.3V or 5V
- Has 2 8-bit timers, one of which also has an associated dead-time generator (useful for induction motors)
- 10-bit ADC differential input with gain either 1x or 20x
- internal temperature sensor (ADC channel 4)
