## ActivityBot 360 with Whiskers

Bill S. showed a modification to his ActivityBot 360. He replaced the ultrasonic sensors with whiskers!

[Here](https://learn.parallax.com/tutorials/robot/activitybot/blocklyprop-robotics-activitybot/navigate-touch/build-whisker-switches) is an 
article about show to add the whiskers.

## QR Code Project
John H. (President) gave a summary and call to arms for implementing a way of ensuring attendees are financial and having attendance at 
Moorabbin recorded with possibly the use of a raspberry pi.

## Nodered malware
One of our regulars was hit with a nodered malware!

The cause is that the nodered editor is unsecured (http), meaning anyone on the web has ability to modify the program, including those with 
malicious intent. Writeup [here](https://raspberrypisig.github.io/blog/nodered/2018/12/08/malware-nodered/).

## Turn a servo into a continous-mode servo
Rob C. shared a little gem: remove the potentiometer from the servo. Analogous to removing a microswitch from a 3d printer axis. Since
the servo thinks it hasn't reached the setpoint, it keeps going!
