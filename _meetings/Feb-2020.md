### Pi camera on a raspberry pi zero

Hank and Gary were having trouble with a pi camera. When I ran raspistill, it would give an error saying that camera not detected.
After some digging, I found a great command to troubleshoot camera

```sh
vcgencmd get_camera
```

The output would say: Supported=1 Detected=0

Supported means whether Camera Support is enabled in Raspberry Pi Configuration(raspi-config->Interfaces>Camera).
Detected=0 means undetected.

It turns out that the camera connector is rather finnicky. After removing it from the case, we finally got
Supported=1 Detected=1 and good to go from there.

### Install raspberry pi on raspberry pi zero

Created an install script [here](https://raspberrypisig.com/blog/raspbian/2020/02/09/install-motioneye-raspbian/). Works with different flavours of Raspbian(Buster, Stretch, Jessie).


### Determine pi temperature

Normally, the command is

```sh
vcgencmd measure_temp
```

If you use a custom OS besides raspbian, that command may not be available. So alternative is to use the following command

```sh
cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
```

### Cron problem

Interesting problem arose where the following snippet was being executed in crontab

```sh
20 14 * * * echo moo > moo-`date +%d-%m-%y`.log
```

The command is perfectly legal, and if you run it in a shell, it works as expected.

The issue is, in the cron, the percentage sign needs to be escaped. So the fix is:

```sh
20 14 * * * echo moo > moo-`date +\%d-\%m-\%y`.log
```
