## Transmit your custom audio across  FM band with PiFmAdv 

Instructions [here](https://github.com/miegl/PiFmAdv)

It works by using GPIO4(pin 7) which is the oscillator pin, which is used to send an RF signal.

You run:

```
sudo ./pi_fm_adv --freq 87.5 --audio sound.wav
```

Then use a radio and tune to 87.5Mhz FM and you should hear the wav file. I was chuffed when I got this to work.

## Use an ADC to access analog devices with raspberry pi
Bought a MCP3008. The great thing about this ADC is that there is direct linux support for it.
Enable SPI(dtparam=spi=on in /boot/config.txt or via raspi-config), make a change to /boot/config.txt (dtoverlay=mcp3008:spi0-0-present
) to load drivers at boot, then access the raw values by simply accessing a virtual file on the filesystem (cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_voltage0_raw
). Nifty.
