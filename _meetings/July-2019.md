# Updates to Raspbian Buster firmware for Raspberry Pi 4

Hank P. suggested that the latest upgrade partially solves some of the heating issues. [This
article](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-4-firmware-update-tested,39791.html) confirms the state of play.

# Raspbian AP mode

I have finally nailed down a reliable procedure to setup Raspberry Pi as a wifi hotspot.

I plan to write a small GUI to make this less painful, and also have a "factory reset" option to cleanly remove AP configuration and sofware.

# Creating and Monitoring PWM signals with Raspberry Pi

With the help of Rob C. and Chris H., was able to demonstrate creating a 30khZ 10% duty cycle signal using the pigpio library.
Could generate both hardware and software PWM signal. Also, used a python program to implement a frequency counter on a GPIO pin.
