## Raspberry Pi TV HAT

Hank P. bought the TV hat from PiHut. Neat. Link [here](https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-tv-hat) and setup instructions

## Transmit audio over FM 
For the ham radio enthusiasts, great piece of software called rpitx that can turn pi into a FM transmitter. Link to software 
[here](https://github.com/F5OEO/rpitx). 

There is a specific use case in the new version - replay captured audio. Useful for automating doorbells etc that use RF.

## Composite video with raspberry pi

Before this week, I was not aware that 3.5mm connector in the raspberry pi is capable of outputing video in addition to audio.

In order to do so, use need a special 4-pole 3.5 mm connector. Not all connectors are the same.
