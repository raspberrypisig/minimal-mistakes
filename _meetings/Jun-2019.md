Bought a Bosch BME680 which measures VOCs(Volatile Organic Compounds) such as paints, chemicals and glues.

John S. is interesting in an LPG detector. Here is a chart describing various categories of gas sensors

##### CODE	GAS SENSITIVITY
MQ–2	Methane, Butane, LPG, smoke
MQ–3	Alcohol, Ethanol, smoke
MQ–4	Methane, CNG gas
MQ–5	Natural gas, LPG
MQ–6	LPG, Propane, Butane
MQ-7	Carbon Monoxide
MQ-8	Hydrogen
MQ–9	Carbon monoxide, Flammable Gasses
MQ–131	Ozone
MQ–135	Benzene, Alcohol, Smoke
MQ–136	Hydrogen Sulfide
MQ–137	Ammonia
MQ–138	Benzene, Toluene, Alcohol, Acetone, Propane, Formaldehyde, Hydrogen
MG-811	Carbon Dioxide

# 128x128 colour tft-lcd display for arduino

Jaycar DuinoTech job.

Based on ST7735. 

Apparently, there is a rpi library
