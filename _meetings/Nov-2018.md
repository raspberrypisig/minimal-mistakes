## More Arduino stuff
Me, Bernd and John M. playing with direct port manipulation on Arduino.
Reference [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PortManipulation).
One thing this allows you to do is write to multiple pins at once. 

Gained understanding of the following operators in C:

-   |    <i>bitwise-or operator</i>
-   &    <i>bitwise-and operator</i>
-   `>`>   <i>right-shift operator</i>
-   <<   <i>left shift operator</i>

Also looked at the SREG register in AVR that stores carry, negative and overflow flags 
(advanced usage).


## Make a dumb Coffee Machine smart with a ESP32

Created a project on github. Details [here](https://github.com/microcontrollersig/coffee-machine-esp32)

The interesting things about project:
- use of ESP32 microcontroller
- Micropython programming
- playing with solid state relays


## LPG Detector using Arduino Nano
