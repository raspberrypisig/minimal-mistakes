## arduino stuff
[Circuits on Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits) provides an Arduino and hardware simulator, run Arduino code, play with
LEDs, oscilloscopes etc.

We had a discussion of interrupts as well. Maybe we should explore this topic further.

## Sonoff POW device
Rob. B gave an update of Tasmota firmware for these devices. Here is a writeup done previously [here](https://raspberrypisig.github.io/blog/iot/2018/01/30/sonoff-tasmota/)

## solar tracking software
[Python Code here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypisig/solartracker/master/deathray/suncalc.py)

Give the code latitude, longitude and time, it will tell you the azimuth and altitude of the sun (azimuth measured from true north clockwise, altitude measured from horizon)

[https://suncalc.org](http://suncalc.org) is a website which gives you a more graphic-rich representation of solar location.

## control servo motor with raspberry pi
Code [here](https://gist.github.com/raspberrypisig/959662ec1482fa109f87772f76a7ccea)

A raspberry pi GPIO pins are 3.3V tolerant, whereas the servo  needs 5V, the consequence being that: a) need to use separate power supply and 
b) used a separate board, 16 channel PWM driver board.

## Python tidbits
Had an interesting discussion about python modules, what they are (basically just normal python code).

## Ideas for future meetings
- attendance app using qr code using python/android
