## Sonoff POW device
Rob. B gave an update of Tasmota firmware for these devices. Here is a writeup done previously (here)[https://raspberrypisig.github.io/blog/iot/2018/01/30/sonoff-tasmota/]

## solar tracking software in python

## control servo motor with raspberry pi
Code (here)[https://gist.github.com/raspberrypisig/959662ec1482fa109f87772f76a7ccea].
A raspberry pi GPIO pins are 3.3V tolerant, whereas the servo  needs 5V, the consequence being that: a) need to use separate power supply and 
b) used a separate board, 16 channel PWM driver board.

## Python tidbits
Had an interesting discussion about python modules, what they are (basically just normal python code).

## Ideas for future meetings
- attendance app using qr code using python/android
