## Where to buy Pi Zero W
Thanks to John S. for info that the mob below have a fresh batch ready to ship.

[Core Electronics](https://core-electronics.com.au/)

Yum yum.

## Install raspbian for Pi Zero W
[Install Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)

## Where is the antenna on the Pi Zero W?
This one is for John M.

## Connect to wireless automatically when booting Pi Zero W
Need to put a file on the SD card after you "burn" raspbian called wpa-supplicant.conf 
Sample of the contents of the file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohankumargupta/raspberrypi-ansible/master/wpa_supplicant-sample.conf)

## Remote VNC
Wasn't aware that RealVNC works over the internet until Rob. C told me about this. It means that you can access your Raspberry Pi Desktop from a remote location. It involves creating a free account with RealVNC website, enabling VNC on the pi, right-clicking VNC icon->Licensing on pi, then can access desktop on your PC or android with realvnc app. Cool.

## Create a custom Raspbian image
My very own. Not for the faint of heart.

## Learn Linux Commands 

First create a directory and some empty files and one file with some content

```sh
mkdir boo
cd boo
touch 1.txt
touch 2.txt
echo "some content for 3.txt" > 3.txt
ls
cd ..
pwd
ls
```

Now lets create a zip file with the contents of that directory

```sh
zip -r boo boo.zip
```

Congrats! You have created a zip file from the command line! Will leave the reverse as an exercise, but here is a hint.

```sh
sudo apt-get -y install unzip
unzip -l boo.zip
```
