## Learn Linux Commands 

First create a directory and some empty files and one file with some content

```sh
mkdir boo
cd boo
touch 1.txt
touch 2.txt
echo "some content for 3.txt" > 3.txt
ls
cd ..
pwd
ls
```

Now lets create a zip file with the contents of that directory

```sh
zip -r boo boo.zip
```

Congrats! You have create a zip file from the command line! Will leave the reverse as an exercise, but here is a hint.

```sh
sudo apt-get -y install unzip
unzip -l boo.zip
```
